# dbt models

Transforming data represented as the 'T' in ELT. 

When you execute 'dbt run', you are running a model that will transform your data without that data ever leaving your warehouse.

Models are where your developers spend most of their time within a dbt environment. Models are primarily written as a select statement and saved as a .sql file. 

While the definition is straightforward, the complexity of the execution will vary from environment to environment. 

Models will be written and rewritten as needs evolve and your organization finds new ways to maximize efficiency.

SQL is the language most dbt users will utilize, but it is not the only one for building models. Starting in version 1.3, dbt Core and dbt Cloud support Python models. 

Python models are useful for training or deploying data science models, complex transformations, or where a specific Python package meets a need â€” such as using the dateutil library to parse dates.
