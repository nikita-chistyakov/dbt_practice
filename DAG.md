A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is like a flowchart that shows how different steps in a process are connected.

* Directed: The arrows show a specific direction (like one step leading to another).
* Acyclic: There are no loops, meaning you can’t go back to a previous step.

Example:
Making a Sandwich 🍞🥪

Think about making a sandwich as a series of steps:

->Get bread
->Spread peanut butter
->Spread jelly
->Put the slices together
->Eat the sandwich

Each step depends on the previous ones, and you can’t go back in the process (you can’t spread peanut butter after you’ve already eaten the sandwich!). 

That’s exactly how a DAG works—it organizes tasks in a way that ensures everything happens in the right order without repeating steps.

DAGs are used in computer science, scheduling tasks, and data pipelines to make sure processes run smoothly and efficiently!
