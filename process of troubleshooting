1. Review logs/dbt.log or run_results.json
Start by examining the logs to understand the error details. Check dbt.log or run_results.json in the logs/ folder for a detailed explanation of what went wrong.
2. View generated SQL
Look at the compiled SQL generated by dbt to see if it aligns with your expectations. This step helps you identify issues with Jinja templates, ref usage, or other dbt-specific syntax.
3. Running generated SQL manually
Copy the generated SQL and run it directly in your database. This allows you to verify whether the issue lies in the SQL itself or with dbtâ€™s execution.
4. Verify fix
After identifying and fixing the issue (e.g., correcting a query, fixing references, or adjusting configurations), re-run the model using:
bash
Copy
dbt run --select <model_name>
Confirm that the issue has been resolved and the model runs successfully.

Final Order of Steps:
- dbt run
- Review logs/dbt.log or run_results.json
- View generated SQL
- Running generated SQL manually
- Verify fix
